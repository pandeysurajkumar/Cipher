# Question_1
Write a Java program to calculate the grade of a student based on their marks using if-else conditional statements. The program should follow these criteria:

Marks >= 90: Grade A
Marks >= 80 and < 90: Grade B
Marks >= 70 and < 80: Grade C
Marks >= 60 and < 70: Grade D
Marks < 60: Grade F
The program should:

Take the marks as input from the command line.
Validate the input to ensure it is a positive integer between 0 and 100.
Display the appropriate grade based on the marks.
# Question_2
Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of primitive data types and type conversion. The program should:

Declare and initialize variables of different primitive data types (int, double, char, and boolean).
Perform type conversion by converting an int to a double and a char to an int.
Print the values of all variables before and after the conversions.
# Question_3
A retail store offers discounts on the total amount of items in a shopping cart based on specific conditions. You need to write a program that calculates the final amount a customer needs to pay after applying a discount. Use primitive data types, type conversion, and conditional statements to solve the problem.
-Conditions:
If the total cart amount is greater than ₹5000, apply a 20% discount.
If the total cart amount is between ₹3000 and ₹5000 (inclusive), apply a 10% discount.
If the total cart amount is less than ₹3000, no discount is applied.
The program should:
Accept the total cart amount as input from the user (use primitive data types).
Calculate the discount and the final amount to be paid.
Use appropriate operators (e.g., arithmetic, relational, and ternary).
Display the discount and final amount in a user-friendly format.
Input: Enter the total cart amount: 4500
output:
Discount: ₹450.0
Final Amount: ₹4050.0
